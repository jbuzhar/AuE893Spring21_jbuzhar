This repository contains scripts and other files for the Assignment submission for Assignment 2 - Working with Git and TurtleSim.  

Scripts and screenshots of the resulting trajectories are found in the 'scripts' repository.  The files contained here are :
circle.py -> makes the turtle move in a circle with constant linear speed and angular velocity, as input by the user
square_openloop.py -> makes the turtle move open loop in a square with distances and velocities predefined
square_closedloop.py -> makes the turtle move from predefined coordinates using a proportional controller. 

These scripts are modified from the turtlesim tutorials rotate.py and gotogoal.py, which are also included.  
The scripts directory also contains screenshots of the trajectories.  

The videos directory contains screenrecordings of these codes being run.  

The assignment file is given in Assignment 2.pdf
